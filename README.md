app.lied.at
===========

We (job seekers) apply for a lot of jobs through various job board sites where we can't keep track of every listing (job descriptions &amp; requirements) that we applied to. For instance, craiglist.org. The problem is if we are emailed or called for an interview, sometimes we may not have any clue about job description, job requirements, company, and salary information.   This is where app.lied.at comes in. An organizer web app to help you save job listings using a firefox/google chrome plugin that you applied for, so you can easily trace back to the actual job listing (even if the listing was deleted) once you are called for an interview.
