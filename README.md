Applied.at
===========

We (job seekers) apply for a lot of jobs through various job board sites, for instance, craiglist.org, where we can't keep track of every listing (job descriptions & requirements) that we applied to. Also, those listings usually get removed or deleted after a certain time. The problem is if we are emailed or called for an interview, often we don't remember about the job description, job requirements, salary, company information, etc.

This is where Applied.at comes in. An organizer web app to help job seekers automatically capture job listings and save right from the web browser using a Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension that you applied for or want to apply to. It helps you to easily trace back to the actual job listing (even if the listing get deleted or expired) anytime, or once you are called for an interview. In addition, it emails and reminds you when to follow-up with a prospective employer (based on your reminder selection). You can also add a list (offline), view your saved listings, and manage follow-up reminders from your iPhone, Android, Blackberry, or Windows Phone using our app or by going to appliedat.com

While many of us are worried about personalized search results and other ways to help job seekers find jobs, the truth is, most of us also need help with the next step in successfully getting a job. To fill this gap of the next step, we are making this app to help job seekers easily and efficiently manage the jobs they applied to and get prepared for potential job interview questions, get follow up email reminders to follow up with the employer, or to simply see the history of the jobs they applied to.
